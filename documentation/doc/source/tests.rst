PyRates.tests
=============

Documentation of all test functions that are included in PyRates.
YAML-based model definitions are loaded from `model_templates.test_resources`.

Notes on Testing
----------------

**Static type checking**

MyPy is used to statically check types. To test, if everything works out, run:

`MYPYPATH=./stubs/ mypy --strict-optional --ignore-missing-imports core`

If you get no output, all type checks are successful. Some issues are ignored using the comment tag

`# type: ignore`

These issues may be too complicated for mypy to recognise them properly - or too complicated to fix immediately,
but might need fixing, nevertheless.


**Running tests with py.test**

We use `py.test` for testing.

Make sure you have `pytest` installed.

Usage:

- from within PyCharm
    - select py.test as default testing framework
    - right-click on tests and select "run py.test in tests"
- from the console
    - navigate to the PyRates base directory
    - run `pytest tests`
