***********************************
Model Definition via YAML Templates
***********************************

Dynamical systems models can be implemented in `PyRates` via a `YAML` interface or a pure `Python`
interface. These two interfaces are introduced in detail in the
`model definition use examples <https://pyrates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_implementations.html>`_.
For the `YAML` interface, `PyRates` employs a domain specific language based on the
`YAML <https://yaml.org/>`__ standard (version 1.2) to define templates.
Templates are building blocks of a network that can be reused across
multiple scales. The following is a summary which fields are allowed or
needed to be defined on a single template.

Operator template
-----------------

.. code:: yaml

   OperatorTemplateName:  # this is the operator name
     description: "..." # (optional) description text (goes into the object's __doc__)
     base: OperatorTemplate  # reference to the Python object that is used as basis
     label: "..." # (optional) alternative name for display
     equations: # single equation string or list of equation strings
     variables: # further information to define aspects of equation variables
       var_name: ... # must be the same as used in the equation
       var_name2: value # values can be any of the following:
           # - plain value, e.g. `0.37`
           # - `input` or `output` or `variable` (in that case, parentheses can be used to provide
           #   initial values, e.g. `variable(0.1+0.4j)` for a complex variable)
           # If a value is given, the variable will be treated as a constant,
           # else as a variable that can change over time.

Node template
-------------

.. code:: yaml

   NodeTemplateName:  # the name of the node template
     description: "..." # (optional) description text (goes into the object's __doc__)
     base: NodeTemplate  # reference to the Python object that is used as basis
     label: "..." # (optional) alternative name for display
     operators:  # list operators or key-value pairs with operator as key and changes as values
       - OperatorA
       - OperatorB

Edge template
-------------

Edge templates are structured just like node templates but with
``EdgeTemplate`` as base

Circuit template
----------------

.. code:: yaml

   CircuitTemplateName:  # the name of the circuit template
     description: "..." # (optional) description text (goes into the object's __doc__)
     base: CircuitTemplate
     label: "..." # (optional) alternative name for display
     nodes: # key-value pairs with internal names of nodes as keys and their template as value
       MyNode1: NodeTemplateName
       MyNode2: NodeTemplateName
     circuits: # key-value pairs with internal names of sub-circuits as keys and their template as value
       SubCircuit1: OtherCircuitTemplateName
       SubCircuit2: OtherCircuitTemplateName
     edges: # list of edges
       # [source, target, type, {weight, delay, other variables}]
       - [MyNode1/OperatorA/var_name, MyNode2/OperatorA/var_name, EdgeTemplateName, {weight: 1, delay: 0.1, op/var_name: 3.1}]
       - [SubCircuit1/node/op/var, MyNode1/op/var, EdgeTempalteName, {weight: 3, ...}]

Template inheritance
--------------------

Templates can inherit from other templates. To do this, the parent
template needs to be specified as ``base``. All other information
given in the new template will be considered as changes to the parent
template. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   MyOperator:
       base: OperatorTemplateName
       equations:
         add: # add additional equations
         replace: # replace parts of the equation strings
            old1: new1
         remove: # remove parts of the equation strings
            - old2
       variables:
         var_name: 2

Adapting templates when called
------------------------------

When a template is referenced in another template, it can also be
changed on-the-fly.

.. code:: yaml

   MyNode:
     operators:
       MyOperator:
         variables:
           var_name: 3

Template paths and YAML aliases
-------------------------------

When referencing a template inside the same file, the template name is
sufficient. For referencing templates outside the current file, it is
necessary to also mention the path to that template. Paths can be either
given as absolute or relative paths with slashes ``/``,
e.g.Â ``../path/to/template``. If the template can be found in a Python
module inside the current environment, the syntax is equivalent to
Python imports: ``path.to.template``. In both cases above, the last
element is interpreted as template name and the one before as filename
of the YAML file. The parser recognizes the file extensions ``.yml`` and
``.yaml``.

To avoid repeating long template paths, the aliasing syntax built into
YAML can be used:

.. code:: yaml

   aliases:  # this keyword is not necessary, but improves readability
     - &ShortName very/long/template/path/that/should/not/be/typed/too/many/times
     - &Shorty2 another/long/template/name/that/is/really/annoying

   MyCircuit:
     ...
     nodes: 
       A: *ShortName
       B: *ShortName
     edges:
       - [A/Op/Var, B/Op/Var, *Shorty2, {weight: 10}]
