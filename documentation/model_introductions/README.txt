Model Introductions
--------------------

Here, you will find introductions of all models that are already implemented in PyRates, i.e. they do not require any
further definition of model equations. For each model, there is a tutorial that introduces the underlying model
equations and demonstrates how to load the model into PyRates and perform simulations on it.
