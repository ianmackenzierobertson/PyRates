YAML-Based Model Definitions
============================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use YAML definition files to implement a neurodynamic model with multiple
interconnected neural populations. In this process, the following questions will be answered:

1. What is a YAML template file?
2. How do I use the YAML templates to define my model
3. What are the roles of the different types of YAML templates used in PyRates?
4. How do I create a network model from a YAML template in Python?

Throughout the tutorial, we will make use of the Jansen-Rit neural mass model [1]_, which describes the dynamic
interactions between 3 neural populations via their average firing rates. It has been used to describe the macroscopic,
electrophysiological activity within a cortical column. A graphic representation of such a model, placed inside a brain
network, can be found in the figure below.

   Figure 1

The structure of the full Jansen-Rit model is depicted in :ref:`fig1` B. As visualized for the pyramidal cell
population in :ref:`fig1` C, the model can be decomposed into a number of generic mathematical operators that can be
used to build the dynamic equations for the Jansen-Rit model. We will use this decomposition to introduce the different
possibilities that exist in PyRates to compose the dynamic equations of a neural population from different operators.
This will be done for all 3 nodes (i.e. populations), which will then be connected via edges to yield the full
Jansen-Rit neural mass model. An alternative, single-operator way of the model definition will be introduced as well.

# What is a YAML template file?
# -----------------------------
#
# `YAML <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`_ is a data formatting specification that aims to be human-readable
# and machine-readable at the same time. It's current installment can be thought of as an extension to the also popular
# JSON standard. PyRates uses YAML files to provide a simple and readable way to define network models without any
# Python code. Each yaml-based model definition will have to be placed inside a yaml file in order to be interpreted
# properly, i.e. the file needs to have the ending *.yaml* or *.yml*.
#
# Building models via YAML templates has several advantages:
#   1. the model definition requires a minimum of syntax
#   2. defining a model via YAML templates means setting up an independent, reusable model configuration file
#      (the .yml file) of small size that can easily be stored, shared and read without any python knowledge
#   3. Each YAML template of a PyRates model structure can be reused as a base template for a new YAML template
#
# However, if you know your way around Python and you prefer to set up your full workflow, from model definition to
# simulation, in Python, this is also possible in PyRates. Check out the Python-based model definition tutorial for
# this.

# %%
# Part 1: Operator Templates
# --------------------------
#
# Operator templates are the way to define the governing mathematical equations of a model in PyRates.
# They are called operators, since the dynamic equations of neural models can often be decomposed into meaningful
# mathematical operators that can be re-used at multiple instances. By defining such mathematical operators as distinct
# operator templates in PyRates, these operators just have to be defined once and can then be used to define different
# parts of a model. We will now go through the 2 major operators that the Jansen-Rit model can be decomposed into.

# %%
# Operator template for the PRO
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Below you see a YAML template that defines the so-called potential-to-rate operator (PRO) used within each neural
# population of the Jansen-Rit model. As the name suggests, this operator transforms the average membrane potential
# within a population into an average firing rate. It is defined by the following instantaneous, sigmoidal transform:
#
# .. math::
#
#       m_{out} = \\frac{m_{max}}{1 + e^{(r (V_{thr} - V))}}.
#
# In this equation, :math:`m_{out}` and :math:`V` represent the average firing rate and membrane potential,
# respectively, while :math:`m_{max}`, :math:`r` and :math:`V_{thr}` are constants defining the maximum firing rate,
# firing threshold variance and average firing threshold within the modeled population, respectively.
# A YAML template representation of this operator would look as follows:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       PRO:
#           base: OperatorTemplate
#           equations: "m_out = m_max / (1. + exp(r*(V_thr - V)))"
#           variables:
#               m_out: output
#               V: input(0.0)
#               m_max: 5.0
#               r: 560.0
#               V_thr: 6e-3
#
# As can be seen, this operator takes a membrane potential :math:`V` as input, and returns a firing rate
# :math:`m_{out}` as output. Its typical, sigmoidal shape can be seen in :ref:`fig1` C.

# %%
# Operator template structure:
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# As can be seen from this definition of an operator, each operator template requires 3 fields:
# :code:`base`, :code:`equations` and :code:`variables`.
#
# :code:`base`
#   - indicates, which operator template to derive this template from
#   - The default base for an operator template is the python class :code:`OperatorTemplate`
#   - If you have other operator templates defined that are derived from :code:`OperatorTemplate`, you can use them as
#     base as well. In this case, you will inherit all equations and variables of this operator template. You can add
#     additional variables, or overwrite existing ones. Equations can only be added, but not overwritten.
#
# :code:`equations`
#   - contains the defining equations of this operator
#   - equations are defined as strings of characters
#   - if the operator is defined by a single equation, you can just provide the string
#   - If there is more than one equation, a list of string-based equations has to be provided. We will see an example of
#     this later.
#
# :code:`variables`
#   - contains the type and value definitions for each variable that appears in :code:`equations`
#   - each variable has to be scalar
#   - each variable definition starts with the name of the variable (i.e. the variable key)
#   - possible values of a variable definition are:
#
#       * :code:`variable` -> for state variables which can change over time. The initial value can be specified in
#         brackets, e.g. :code:`variable(0.1)`
#       * :code:`input` -> the variable will be provided with a value from a previous operator or external,
#         user-defined input
#       * :code:`output` -> the value of this variable can be connected to another operator
#       * a scalar value, e.g. :code:`m_max: 5.0` -> indicates that this variable is a constant with value 5.0
#   - be aware that there is a difference between the variable definition :code:`a: 1` and :code:`1.0`, i.e. PyRates
#     distinguishes between integers and float variables and requires matching variable types in mathematical
#     operations.
#

# %%
# Operator template for the RPO
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The second important operator in a Jansen-Rit model is the rate-to-potential operator (RPO). It is conceptualized
# as convolution with an alpha kernel, which can be expressed as a second-order description of the synaptic response
# dynamics:
#
# .. math::
#       \dot V = I, \\
#       \dot I = \frac{H}{\tau} m_{in} - \frac{2 I}{\tau} - \frac{V}{\tau^2}.
#
# In these equations, :math:`V` represents the average post-synaptic potential and :math:`H` and :math:`\tau` are the
# efficacy and the time-scale of the synapse, respectively.
# A PyRates YAML template for the RPO could look as shown below:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       RPO_e:
#           base: OperatorTemplate
#           equations: ['d/dt * V = V_t',
#                       'd/dt * V_t = H/tau * m_in - 2 * V_t/tau - V/tau^2']
#           variables:
#               V: output
#               I: variable
#               m_in: input
#               tau: 0.01
#               H: 0.00325
#
# This is an example of an operator with multiple equations, which are provided as a list of strings. The operator takes
# a firing rate :math:`m_{in}` as input and returns a membrane potential :math:`V` as an output. The unit response of
# that operator is depicted in :ref:`fig1` C. We use the sub-script *e* to denote that this operator defines the
# synaptic response dynamic for an excitatory synapse. Since the PC population of the Jansen-Rit model expresses
# inhibitory synapses as well (see :ref:`fig1` B and C), we also need to define an inhibitory version of such a
# synapse. This operator for this synapse will differ from the :code:`RPO_e` operator only in the constant values for
# :math:`H` and :math:`\tau`, i.e. it will have a different strength and different decay rate. However, since the
# governing equations will be equal, we can use the :code:`RPO_e` operator as the base template:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       RPO_i:
#           base: RPO_e
#           variables:
#               tau: 0.02
#               H: -0.022
#
# Note, that we only re-defined the constants that needed to be changed, whereas everything else will be inherited from
# :code:`RPO_e`.

# %%
# Part 2: Node Templates
# ----------------------
#
# Node templates are what is used in PyRates to define the dynamic equations of a network node
# (e.g. a neural population) via a hierarchy of operators, such as the ones defined above.
# Using the two operator templates defined above (PRO and RPO), each population of the Jansen-Rit model can be defined.
# As shown in :ref:`fig1` B, there exist 3 of those: pyramidal cells (PCs), excitatory interneurons (EINs) and
# inhibitory interneurons (IINs). We will now define separate node templates for each population.

# %%
# Node template for the EIN population
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# As can be seen in in :ref:`fig1` B, the EIN population receives its only (excitatory) input from the PC population.
# To model the dynamic changes in the membrane potential that are caused by the firing rate input from the PC
# population, the :code:`RPO_e` operator is used. Furthermore, the EIN population projects back to the PC population
# via an excitatory synapse. To receive the average firing rate of the EIN population that is required to implement this
# projection, the PRO operator has to be applied to the output of the RPO operator. This provides the operator hierarchy
# that governs the role of the EIN population in the Jansen-Rit model. A node template of this population would look as
# follows:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       EIN:
#           base: NodeTemplate
#           operators:
#               - RPO_e
#               - PRO

# %%
# Node template structure
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In comparison to operator templates, node templates only require the definition of 2 fields:
# :code:`base` and :code:`operators`.
#
# :code:`base`
#   - defines which node template to derive this specific node template from
#   - The default base for a node template is the python class :code:`NodeTemplate`
#   - If you have other node templates defined that are derived from :code:`NodeTemplate`, you can use them as base as
#     well. In this case, you will inherit all operators of this template. You can add additional
#     operators, but not overwrite existing ones.
#
# :code:`operators`
#   - contains a list of names of previously defined operators
#   - each list entry starts with a :code:`-` on a new line
#   - operator hierarchies are automatically derived from the :code:`input` and :code:`output` variables of each
#     operator
#   - thus, the sequence in which the operators are placed inside the node template does not matter
#   - however, circular dependencies between the operator inputs and outputs should be prevented (PyRates throws an
#     error if such circularities are detected)
#   - thus, an output variable on one operator, that should connect to the input variable of another operator, needs to
#     have the same name as this input variable

# %%
# Node template for the IIN population
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# As can be seen in :ref:`fig1` B, the IIN population shows an identical connectivity to the PC population as the EIN
# population. Thus, it expresses an identical operator structure. The only difference between EIN and IIN population is
# how their projections back to the PC population affect the PC membrane potential, which is excitatory and inhibitory,
# respectively. Hence, we will define the IIN population template as follows:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       EIN:
#           base: NodeTemplate
#           operators:
#               - RPO_e
#               - PRO

# %%
# Node template for the PC population
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Now, the center piece of the Jansen-Rit model is the PC population, which receives input from both the EIN and the IIN
# population. Their synapses have opposing influences on its membrane potential (note the different signs of the
# synaptic efficacies :math:`H` used for the :code:`RPO_e` and :code:`RPO_i` operator definitions) and need to be
# implemented via two separate operators that govern the synaptic dynamics of the EIN to PC and IIN to PC projections.
# Otherwise, the structure of the PC population is the same as that of the EIN and IIN population:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       PC:
#           base: NodeTemplate
#           operators:
#               - RPO_e
#               - RPO_i
#               - PRO
#
# Since both the :code:`RPO_e` and the :code:`RPO_i` operator express an output variable :math:`V` and the :code:`PRO`
# operator requires :math:`V` as an input, PyRates will detect that there are multiple outputs mapping to a single
# input variable. In such a case, a sum will be calculated over all output variables first, which is then provided as
# input variable to the respective operator. In this specific example, the input :math:`m_{in}` of the PRO operator on
# the PC population will be calculated as :math:`m_{in} = V_e + V_i` where :math:`V_e` and :math:`V_i` refer to the
# output variables of the :code:`RPO_e` and :code:`RPO_i` operators, respectively.

# %%
# Part 3: Edge Templates
# ----------------------
#
# Edge templates allow to define the dynamic equations for projections between nodes. For example, they could be used to
# model axonal delay distributions via a convolution with a delay distribution function. For this purpose, PyRates
# provides the :code:`EdgeTemplate` base template. It follows exactly the same structure as a
# :code:`NodeTemplate`, i.e. it is defined via a :code:`base` and a colletion of :code:`operators`. Since the Jansen-Rit
# model uses very simple, linear projection operations (see the coupling operator *CO* in :ref:`fig1` D), no edge
# templates are required for this model. A detailed tutorial for how to implement different forms of edge operations
# such as delays, convolutions etc., will be provided by the *edge definitions* example in this gallery.

# %%
# Part 4: Circuit Templates
# -------------------------
#
# A circuit template is what is used in PyRates to combine a set of nodes and edges to a full network model.

# %%
# A circuit template for the Jansen-Rit model
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the case of the Jansen-Rit model, this translates to connecting the PC, EIN and IIN populations via simple, linear
# edges that can be set up within the :code:`CircuitTemplate` as follows:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#       JRC:
#           base: CircuitTemplate
#           nodes:
#               EIN: EIN
#               IIN: IIN
#               PC: PC
#           edges:
#               - [PC/PRO/m_out, IIN/RPO_e/m_in, null, {weight: 33.75}]
#               - [PC/PRO/m_out, EIN/RPO_e/m_in, null, {weight: 135.}]
#               - [EIN/PRO/m_out, PC/RPO_e/m_in, null, {weight: 108.}]
#               - [IIN/PRO/m_out, PC/RPO_i/m_in, null, {weight: 33.75}]
#

# %%
# Circuit template structure
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# A circuit template requires the definition of 3 fields: :code:`base`, :code:`nodes` and :code:`edges`.
#
# :code:`base`
#   - defines which circuit template to derive this specific circuit template from
#   - The default base for a circuit template is the python class :code:`CircuitTemplate`
#   - If you have other circuit templates defined that are derived from :code:`CircuitTemplate`, you can use them as
#     base as well. In this case, you will inherit all nodes and edges of this template. You can add additional nodes
#     and edges and overwrite existing nodes, but not edges.
#
# :code:`nodes`
#   - lists all nodes that this circuit is composed of
#   - each node definition starts in a new line, with the name that is given to the node within the circuit, followed
#     by the name of the node template that should be used (:code:`name_within_circuit: name_of_node_template`)
#
# :code:`edges`
#   - if no edges exist in circuit, this field can be skipped
#   - else, edges are defined by lists with four entries:
#
#       1. The source variable (`PC/PRO/m_out` refers to variable `m_out` in operator `PRO` of node `PC`)
#       2. The target variable
#       3. An edge template with additional operators (here, `null` means that no particular edge template is used).
#       4. A dictionary of variables and values that are specific to this edge.
#
#   - more complex syntax can be used within the four entries to define more complex edges. A tutorial on how to use
#     these will be provided by the *edge definitions* example in this gallery.
#
# This concludes the YAML-based definition of the Jansen-Rit model in PyRates.
# To learn how to use this model definition to perform numerical simulations, check out the other examples in this
# gallery.
